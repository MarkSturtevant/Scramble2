Note: all of the code in the GUI folder is decompiled from the finished copy of Scramble 2.  The logic is nearly the same as the original code, with a few exceptions:

- All comments got deleted

- Many constant (final) variables were used, but their variable references got replaced with their values

- Few other minor, organizational changes (such as variable names or format issues)
